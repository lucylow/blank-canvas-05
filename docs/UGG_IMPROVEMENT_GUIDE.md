# U.GG League of Legends Improvement Guide

U.GG is one of the best data-driven tools for League improvement - analyzes millions of games to show highest WR builds, runes, counters. Here's how to use it systematically to climb.

## 1. U.GG Core Features for Improvement

### TIER LISTS (Patch 16.2 Emerald+):
*   ✅ Role-specific rankings (S/A/B tiers)
*   ✅ Matchup-specific WR (Gragas vs Morde)
*   ✅ Skill order + summoners optimal

### BUILD PATHS (Highest WR):
*   ✅ Core build (95th percentile players)
*   ✅ Situational items ranked by WR
*   ✅ Boots timing recommendations
*   ✅ Rune pages (primary/secondary/shards)

## 2. Daily U.GG Workflow (15min → +1.5% WR)

### Pre-Game (5min)
1.  **CHECK TIER LIST**:
    *   Your role → S/A tier only (54%+ WR)
    *   Enemy comp counters (avoid F tier matchups)
2.  **BUILD IMPORT**:
    *   Copy highest WR build (click "BUILD")
    *   Import runes (1-click client)
    *   Screenshot situational items
3.  **MATCHUP NOTES**:
    *   Enemy laner → "Counters" tab
    *   Write down: "Dodge Q, freeze wave"

### In-Game (Passive awareness)
*   **U.GG OVERLAY (Optional)**:
    *   Alt+Tab → Check item spikes
    *   Hover "Next Item?" → WR comparison
    *   Track enemy core completion
*   **MENTAL CHECKS (Every back)**:
    *   □ U.GG build path correct?
    *   □ Boots timing optimal? 
    *   □ Situational vs enemy comp?

### Post-Game (5min)
1.  **U.GG REPLAY ANALYSIS**:
    *   Click your match → "Build" tab
    *   Compare: Your items vs 95th percentile
    *   WR diff per item choice
2.  **DEATH REVIEW**:
    *   Death #1 → Hover enemy items
    *   "Would MR have saved?" → Buy next

## 3. U.GG Data-Driven Climb System

### WEEKLY U.GG AUDIT (30min):

1.  **CHAMP POOL OPTIMIZATION**:
    *   Filter Emerald+ → Your 3 mains
    *   WR <54% → Bench immediately
    *   Promote flex champ (53%+ → 51%+ games)

2.  **BUILD OPTIMIZATION**:
    *   Core build WR vs your WR
    *   3% diff → Practice in norms
    *   Situational items → Bookmark top 3

3.  **RUNE OPTIMIZATION**:
    *   Primary rune WR diff
    *   Shard optimization (AS vs Adaptive)
    *   Secondary tree WR (Resolve vs Sorcery)

## 4. U.GG Advanced Features

### Matchup Builds (Gold+ Essential)
**EXAMPLE**: Aatrox vs Darius
*   U.GG → Aatrox → Counters → Darius
*   Shows: Plated Steelcaps 57.2% WR
*   vs Berserker 52.1% WR
*   **+5.1% WR impact**

### Situational Items (Platinum+)
**VS ENEMY COMPS**:
*   Heavy CC → Merc Treads (not Sorcerers)
*   Tank stack → %HP items (not straight AD)
*   Burst threat → Zhonya/Stopwatch slot

### Skill Order (Diamond+)
U.GG shows ACTUAL skill orders (not theory)
**EX**: Sylas E max 1st (57% WR) vs Q max (51%)
→ **+6% WR from skill order alone**

## 5. U.GG vs Other Tools

*   **U.GG ✅ (Data science approach)**
    *   Emerald+ filter (relevant games)
    *   WR confidence intervals
    *   Live patch updates (<1hr)
*   **OP.GG ❌ (All elos mixed)**
    *   Iron-GM averaged
    *   Less matchup granularity
*   **LOLALYTICS ✅ (Deep matchup stats)**
    *   Expensive ($10/mo)
    *   U.GG 90% as good, free

## 6. Common U.GG Mistakes (Avoid)

*   ❌ WR <52% → "Must be smurf queue"
    *   TRUTH: Wrong champ/build/runes
*   ❌ Blind copy highest WR build
    *   TRUTH: Check "95th percentile" tab
*   ❌ Ignore situational items
    *   TRUTH: Enemy comp changes everything
*   ✅ **U.GG → 95th %ile → Adapt 1-2 items**

## 7. U.GG 30-Day Climb Challenge

*   **Week 1: Build discipline (54% WR target)**
    *   U.GG import EVERY game
    *   95th percentile builds only
    *   Track WR diff per item
*   **Week 2: Matchup mastery**
    *   Study 3 enemy laner counters
    *   Boots timing per matchup
    *   Situational item adaptation
*   **Week 3: Rune optimization**
    *   Test U.GG vs coach guides
    *   Secondary tree WR comparison
    *   Shard optimization
*   **Week 4: Pool refinement**
    *   Bench <53% WR champs
    *   Promote rising flex picks
    *   Meta adaptation (S-tier only)

## 8. Expected WR Gains

*   Baseline (No U.GG): 49.5% WR
*   U.GG Builds: 51.2% WR (+1.7%)
*   U.GG + Matchups: 52.8% WR (+3.3%)
*   U.GG + Review: 54.1% WR (+4.6%)

1.  u.gg/lol/tier-list → Role → Champ
2.  "BUILD" button → Import runes/items
3.  Screenshot situational items
4.  Queue → Execute → Win (+2.1% WR)

**15 seconds → Diamond+ builds guaranteed.**

**U.GG isn't cheating - it's data science.** Top 1% players use it. Execute systematically → **54% WR minimum.** 🎯
