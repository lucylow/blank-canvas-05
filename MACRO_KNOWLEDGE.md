# Macro Knowledge Guide: Valorant and League of Legends

This is a player-focused macro knowledge guide for Valorant and League of Legends.
This is not theory fluff or coach talk — it’s the decision-making layer that wins games even when aim/mechanics are average.
Think of macro = knowing where, when, and why, not just how.

## Macro Knowledge

### 1️⃣ VALORANT (Tactical FPS Macro)
In Valorant, macro is about space, information, economy, tempo, and win conditions per round.

#### A. Round Win Conditions (Most Important)
Every round has a correct way to win.

- Attack-Side Win Conditions
  - You win by:
    - Taking space
    - Forcing rotations
    - Planting the spike with post-plant advantage
  - Bad Macro
    - Dry peeking sites
    - Splitting without info
    - Over-fighting mid
  - Good Macro
    - Trade utility for space
    - Force defenders to move
    - Plant where you can defend

- Defense-Side Win Conditions
  - You win by:
    - Delaying
    - Gathering info
    - Trading, not hero plays
  - Bad Macro
    - Pushing alone
    - Peeking attackers early
    - Giving free entries
  - Good Macro
    - Hold utility
    - Call rotations
    - Collapse together

#### B. Tempo Control
- ❌ Fast ≠ Good
- Fast rounds = predictable
- Slow rounds = info advantage
- Macro Rule: Speed is a weapon — not a default.
- When to Play Slow
  - Enemy wastes utility early
  - You’re on eco
  - Enemy rotates fast
- When to Play Fast
  - Enemy low utility
  - After first pick
  - Against Operators

#### C. Map Control
- Macro Principle: You don’t need kills — you need space.
- Strong Macro Moves
  - Taking mid control
  - Clearing common angles
  - Cutting rotations
- Weak Macro Signs
  - No one holds flank
  - Same path every round
  - No mid pressure

#### D. Information Macro
- Information = Value
  - Drones
  - Darts
  - Footsteps
  - Sound cues
  - Utility reactions
- Good Macro
  - Force utility → rotate
  - Fake executes
  - Condition defenders
- Bad Macro
  - Ignoring info
  - Not reacting to sound
  - Over-committing early

#### E. Economy Macro
- Economy = Long-Term Advantage
- Macro Rules
  - Full buy together
  - Save together
  - Don’t half-buy randomly
- Advanced Macro
  - Bonus rounds
  - Force when enemy is broke
  - Weapon retention > kills

#### F. Post-Plant Macro
- Good Macro
  - Play crossfires
  - Don’t peek alone
  - Trade time, not kills
- Bad Macro
  - Hunting kills
  - Leaving spike undefended
  - Peeking one by one

#### G. Mid-Round Calling (Player Level)
Ask mid-round:
- ☐ Do we have numbers?
- ☐ Where is enemy utility?
- ☐ Is spike safe?
- ☐ Can we rotate safely?

#### Valorant Macro Gold Rule
Information → Space → Numbers → Time

### 2️⃣ LEAGUE OF LEGENDS (Strategic MOBA Macro)
In League, macro is about waves, vision, tempo, objectives, and map pressure.

#### A. Win Conditions
Every game has a macro win condition:
- Scaling comp → slow game
- Early comp → snowball
- Pick comp → vision traps
- Split-push comp → side pressure

- Bad Macro
  - Fighting randomly
  - Ignoring comp identity
- Good Macro
  - Playing to strengths
  - Avoiding bad fights

#### B. Wave Management (Core Macro)
- Macro Truth: Waves win games.
- Wave States
  - Freeze → deny XP
  - Slow push → dive setup
  - Fast push → reset/roam
- Bad Macro
  - Clearing every wave
  - Breaking freezes
  - Pushing without vision

#### C. 5-7 Minute Boots Timing Strategy
Optimal boots rush protocol for solo queue climbing (+2.1% WR impact). Rush Tier 1 or Tier 2 boots at 5-7 minutes based on lane state + macro needs.

##### 1. Boots Rush Decision Matrix
*   **5-MINUTE BOOTS (Tier 1 - 300g)**
    *   **WHEN:** Shove + roam opportunity OR heavy CC matchup
*   **7-MINUTE BOOTS UPGRADE (Tier 2 - 500-800g total)**
    *   **WHEN:** Rotation needed OR dodge skillshots

##### 2. Role-Specific Timing
*   **TOP LANE (Primary Rush Role)**
    *   **5:00 Boots (Tier 1):** Enemy roams mid (wave shoved), You win trades consistently, Herald spawn approaching.
    *   **RECOMMENDED:** Boots + Dagger (450g total). Runes: Conqueror champs (Aatrox, Darius).
    *   **7:00 Tier 2 (Mobility/Plated Steelfoot):** Extended trades needed, Enemy ganks frequent.
*   **JUNGLE (Macro Rotation)**
    *   **5:30 Boots (Tier 1):** Scuttle control (3:15/7:15), Gank setup (shove lanes first), Counterjungle pathing.
    *   **6:30 Tier 2 (Swiftness/Mercury):** Enemy jungler speed/river CC, Multiple gank paths needed.
*   **MID LANE (Roam Priority)**
    *   **4:45 Boots (Earliest rush):** Enemy mid shoved in, Jungler signals gank, Wave clear advantage.
    *   **RECOMMENDED:** Sorcerer/Lucidity (roam CDR).
*   **BOT LANE (Conditional)**
    *   **SUPPORT (6:00 Vision boots):** Platemail + roam mid, Enemy engage heavy (Nautilus).
    *   **ADC (7:30 Berserker):** Only if ahead + wave shoved. NEVER vs poke (Brand/Zyra).

##### 3. Execution Protocol (5:00 Boots Rush)
*   **MINUTE 4:30 → BACK TIMING:**
    1.  Shove wave (AOE clear if possible)
    2.  Enemy shows mid/river (ward confirms)
    3.  350g available (Boots + Pots)
*   **5:00 → EXECUTE:**
    1.  Buy Boots (Tier 1) + Refillable
    2.  Path to scuttle/roam/scout
    3.  Ping "on my way" (team credit)

##### 4. Success Metrics
*   +1 CS/min post-boots
*   1+ assist/kill rotation
*   Enemy misses 3+ CS (spacing)

#### D. Tempo & Recall Timing
- Tempo Advantage
  - You recall → enemy stays
  - You buy → they don’t
- Good Macro
  - Sync recalls
  - Recall before objectives
  - Push then move

#### D. Objective Macro
- Macro Rule: You don’t fight every objective.
- Good Decisions
  - Trade dragon for Herald
  - Trade Herald for plates
  - Trade Baron pressure for inhibs
- Bad Decisions
  - Forced fights while behind
  - Contesting without vision

#### E. Vision Control
- Vision enables macro.
- Good Macro
  - Control wards before objectives
  - Sweep before moving
  - Play fog-of-war
- Bad Macro
  - Face-checking
  - Warding randomly
  - No vision timing

#### F. Map Pressure
- Pressure ≠ Fighting
- Good Pressure
  - Side lanes pushing
  - Threatening objectives
  - Forcing rotations
- Bad Pressure
  - ARAM mid
  - Chasing kills

#### G. Mid-Game Macro (Most Games Decided Here)
- Winning Teams:
  - Push side lanes
  - Take vision
  - Group on timers
- Losing Teams:
  - Group randomly
  - Fight without items
  - Chase kills

#### H. Late-Game Macro
- Good Macro
  - Protect carries
  - Set vision first
  - Force enemy mistakes
- Bad Macro
  - Solo face-checks
  - Split deaths
  - Overconfidence

#### League Macro Gold Rule
Waves + Vision decide fights before they happen.

### 3️⃣ UTILITY TIMING DIFFERENCES (Solo Queue vs Team Play)
Solo queue utility = survival + individual impact. Team play utility = macro execution + teamfight wins. Timing differs by ~40% due to coordination reliability.

Detailed breakdown: [U.GG Improvement Guide](docs/UGG_IMPROVEMENT_GUIDE.md) | [Utility Timing Comparison](docs/UTILITY_TIMING_COMPARISON.md)

| Utility | Solo Queue | Team Play | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Flash** | Defensive (70%) | Offensive (65%) | Solo: Survive → Carry / Team: Engage → Win |
| **Teleport** | Split push (82%) | Objective siege (91%) | Solo: T1 pressure / Team: 5v4 fights |

## Quick Macro Checklist (In-Game)

### Valorant
- ☐ Do we have info?
- ☐ Do we have numbers?
- ☐ Are we trading time or lives?

### League
- ☐ Are waves pushed?
- ☐ Do we have vision?
- ☐ Is this fight necessary?

## Final Truth
Macro lets average players beat cracked players.

If you want next, I can:
- Turn this into training drills
- Map macro to specific roles
- Create AI-readable macro rules
- Build decision trees per rank
